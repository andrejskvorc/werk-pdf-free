# werk-pdf-free
App writen in C# and Visual Studio 2017 for splitting and merging PDF files with Material Design UI using PDFSharp/MigraDoc

Application is using NuGet Packages log4net v2.0.8, MaterialSkin.Updated v0.2.2 and PDFSharp v1.50.5147.

This is my first-time using GitHub and I hope everything is here...

I still need to work on code commenting, but I hope someone will find this also useful...

Binaries will be published on my private servers for those that just to install and use it...

Now Iâ€™m working od PDF Splitting part, merging is next, and viewing is last on my agenda...

Hope I will create two installation types, one for Click Once Deployment and one with classic installer
