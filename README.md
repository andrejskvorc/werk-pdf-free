App for spliting and mering PDF files with Material Desing UI using PDFSharp/MigraDoc

I'm using this NuGetPackages log4net v2.0.8, MaterialSkin.Updated v0.2.2 and PDFsharp v1.50.5147.

This is my first time using GitHub and i hope everything is here...

I still need to work on code commenting, but i hope someone will find this also usefull...

Binaries will be pubished on my private servers for those that want just to install and use it...

At the moment i'm working od PDF Splitting part, merging is next and viewing is last on my agenda...
