# werk-pdf-free
App writen in C# and Visual Studio 2017 for splitting and merging PDF files with Material Design UI using PDFSharp/MigraDoc

Application is using NuGet Packages log4net v2.0.8, MaterialSkin.Updated v0.2.2,  PDFSharp and MigraDoc v1.50.5147,  Pdfium, VisualBasic Powerpack

This is my first-time using GitHub and I hope everything is here...

I still need to work on code commenting, but I hope someone will find this also useful...

Binaries will be published on my private servers for those that just to install and use it...

Spliting PDF files and Merging PDF files is finished. Now just need to make view component, create installlers and then localization to Croatian, English and German language and also finish implementation of loging errors...

Hope I will create two installation types, one for Click Once Deployment and one with classic installer
